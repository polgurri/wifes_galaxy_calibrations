# WIFES VEL FIELD CALIBRATION P.GURRI '2019'

------------------------------------
Complete calibration of velocity fields of WIFES data ANU 2.3m

Calibration includes flux-calibration and skysubtraction (PCA based)


# Purpose
------------------------------------

These scripts were used to analyise for the first time the velocity fields of weakly lensed galaxies.

Access to all the data can be found here: http://dx.doi.org/10.26185/5f488683e4867


# How To use
------------------------------------

Simply need to point to pywifes calibrated cubes with their corresponding standard star

A calibrated velocity map will be created for each galaxy

Please use this as a reference only, as many parameters have been tuned to suit this particular research case
