WIFES VEL FIELD CALIBRATION P.GURRI '2019'

------------------------------------
Complete calibration of velocity fields of WIFES data ANU 2.3m

Calibration includes flux-calibration and skysubtraction (PCA based)

Simply need to point to a pywifes calibrated cube with corresponding standard star

Final velocity map will be created for the galaxy

Please use this as a reference only, as many parameters have been tuned to suit this particular research case
